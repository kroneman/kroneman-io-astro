## Ignoring github pages branch in Vercel deployments

After setting up github pages to host storybook.
Vercel's preview build was breaking on trying to spin up a preview branch.

This lead me down the rabbit-hole of learning how to ignore builds in vercel.

1. Log into vercel
2. Go to your project
3. Then Settings > Git
4. Scroll down to "Ignored Build Step"
5. Add the following to ignore gh pages

```
[[ "$VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF" == "gh-pages" ]] && exit 0
```

You can also add a script to get more fine-grained control.
In my case I use

```
[[ "$VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF" == "gh-pages" ]] && exit 0 || bash bin/vercel-ignore-build
```

Where [bin/vercel-ignore-build](bin/vercel-ignore-build) is a script in this repository
